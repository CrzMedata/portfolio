## Projects
### **Racial Disparity in the Associations of Cotinine with Insulin Secretion: Data from NHANES 2007-2012** 
[publication](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167260)
- **Objective**: This study used the data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2007-2012, using multiple logistic regression models with a survey package from R.  
- **Background**: Although relationships between smoking/high cotinine and type 2 diabetes have consistently been observed, few studies have investigated the relationship between cotinine and underlying pathophysiological defects that characterize diabetes etiology. This study aimed to test the associations between cotinine and measures of insulin resistance or insulin secretion.
- **Methods**: This analysis included 5,751 non-diabetic adult Americans from NHANES (2007-2012). Insulin function was represented with two indexes: insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and insulin secretion index (HOMA-B) estimated by homeostasis model assessment.
- **Results**: Cotinine concentration was not associated with the risk of high HOMA-IR. Association of cotinine with low HOMA-B existed and differed by race/ethnicity (P for interaction <0.05). High cotinine concentration was associated with an increased risk of low HOMA-B among white and black participants but not among Mexican or other Hispanic participants.
- **Conclusion**: High cotinine is associated with decreased insulin secretion function only in white and black non-diabetic U.S. adult populations. Results evaluating cotinine in ethnically homogeneous populations may not be broadly generalizable to other racial/ethnic groups.

### **Short Sleep Duration and Insulin Resistance in Chinese Adult Twins**
- **Objective**: To investigate the association between sleep duration and insulin resistance in rural Chinese adults and examine whether such associations are independent of adiposity.
- **Methods**: This cross-sectional analysis involved 854 men and 640 women aged 20 to 70 years from the Anqing Twin Cohort. Key variables included body mass index (BMI), percentage of trunk fat, fasting plasma glucose, insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), and sleep duration.
- **Results**: Short sleep duration was associated with increased insulin resistance in women but not in men. After adjusting for adiposity variables, the association remained significant in women.
- **Conclusion**: In this rural Chinese cohort, short sleep duration is independently associated with increased insulin resistance among women, even after adjusting for adiposity.

### **Association of Adiposity Trajectories with Insulin Sensitivity and Glycemic Deterioration: A Longitudinal Study of Rural Chinese Twin Adults**
- **Objective**: To evaluate associations between adiposity trajectories over time and insulin sensitivity and glucose deterioration in a Chinese twin cohort.
- **Methods**: This longitudinal study focused on 341 males and 292 females aged 20-50 years, with an average of 6 years between clinical visits. Trajectories for BMI, waist circumference, and body fat percentage were analyzed, along with insulin sensitivity and glycemic outcomes.
- **Results**: Stable or increasing adiposity was linked to lower insulin sensitivity and higher risk of glycemic deterioration. Genetic factors were a significant influence on adiposity, while environmental factors were stronger influences on insulin sensitivity.
- **Conclusion**: When adiposity stays or becomes high, insulin sensitivity decreases, and the risk of glycemic deterioration increases. Environmental factors largely drive the relationship between adiposity and insulin sensitivity.
